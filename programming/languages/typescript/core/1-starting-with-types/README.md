# Starting With Types in TS

This is a basic TypeScript program that demonstrates how to add two numbers and display the result using HTML and TypeScript.

## Installation

To run this program, you will need to have TypeScript installed. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory and compile the TypeScript file using the following command:

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

This will generate a JavaScript file named app.js in the same directory. You can then open the index.html file in your browser to see the program in action.

The program will display two input fields, a button to add the two numbers, and a div to display the result. To add two numbers, simply enter the two numbers in the input fields and click on the "Add" button. The program will then display the result in the div.
