# Uing Array's [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) and [sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) methods in JS

The example here, demonstrates how we can use _slice_ (in order to have a fresh copy of an array, so that we don't change the original one when applying functions like push, pop, reverse, sort, etc.) and _sort_ to **sort out the elemetns in an array (in a functional way!)**
