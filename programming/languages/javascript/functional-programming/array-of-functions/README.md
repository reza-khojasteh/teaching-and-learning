# Array of Functions

The example here, demonstrates one other way **treating functions as data** in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) can be useful.

In this example, we _use an array of functions which could hold references, either to **user-defined functions** or to **built-in/library functions**_.
