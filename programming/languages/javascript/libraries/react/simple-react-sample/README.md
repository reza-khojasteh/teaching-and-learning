# Comparing A Simple Web App Done In React Vs. Just JS

This is just a demo app which shows a few cards with subject names that when clicked on the "More..." button, present a bit more info of the subject to the user.

The user could then either click on any of the two buttons on the overlay/modal or on the backdrop to dismiss that.

You could compare the react app vs. the other approach using just JS (in "same-as-react-app-with-just-js" folder) too see how **more declarative, modular, component-roiented, and simpler to understand and expand** the "React" version is _(please note that, for the sake of simplicity, in the "Just JS" version, we have shown just one card.)_
