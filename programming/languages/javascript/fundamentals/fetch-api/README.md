# Five Friends

A simple solution to work with fetch api (and a bit of async/await!)

## What You'll Do

You're working on a new component for"Your Space", a brand new social media application for finding friends. This component displays a user's top five friends.

Given some JSON, dynamically generate thumbnails for the top five friends. You can append these thumbnails to the `<div id="timeline"></div>`.

## Requirements

- Use the random user API: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5
- Use async/await
- Use fetch()
- Use DOM manipulation to dynamically generate five medium-sized images for each person
