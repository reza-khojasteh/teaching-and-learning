# Technical Books

Creating a simple solution for a TechnicalBook object which inherits from a Book object, both before ES6 and after that

## What You'll Do

Expanding on your previous book application you now want to create a class for technical books. Using the Book class constructed in the last example, extend the functionality to the new TechnicalBook class.

The new TechnicalBook class will take a book edition as a fifth argument.

You should add a getEdition method which prints `The current version of this book is ${version}`.

## Requirements

- Use JavaScript's class notation
