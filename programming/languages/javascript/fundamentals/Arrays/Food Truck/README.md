# Food Truck

Creating a simple solution for a food truck app, using array's flat method, a Set, and a bit of DOM manipulation

## What You'll Do

You're organizing a food truck festival with many different vendors. Each vendor has a menu and some vendors might be serving the same item.

Given an array of food truck menus, return one master menu which contains all food items to be served, without duplicates.

```
Input: [['Tacos', 'Burgers'], ['Pizza'], ['Burgers', 'Fries']]
Output:
- Tacos
- Burgers
- Pizza
- Fries

```

## Requirements

- Use Sets
- Dynamically generate list items containing the unique menu items
