# URLify

A simple solution using regex in JS

## What You'll Do

Create a function called urlify which takes in a blog title and outputs a url-friendly string where each word is lowercase and spaces are replaced with hyphens. Remember to remove all apostrophes.

```
("How I Got Into Programming!!!") => "how-i-got-into-programming"
```

## Requirements

- String manipulation
