# Using ES6 [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)

In this mehtod, we **prevent name collisions** using _ES6 new primitive data type, Symbol_. When we create a symbol, its value is **kept private and would be just for internal use**.

With the help of an IIFE, we _return a class which could be used to create objects_ which have _kind of_ **private data** which can't be accessed from outside their class.

Look at the sample in this folder to see an example.
