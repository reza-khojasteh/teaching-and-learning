# Privates in JS

Although in many other languages, you can use the **private** keyword to implement some kind of privacy, there is no _“direct”_ way to create a private variable in JavaScript.

Please note that these ways I present in here, _are by no means, an exhaustive/complete list of all possible ways_ you might have in JS to do so.
