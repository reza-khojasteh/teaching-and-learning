# Using [TC39 private class field proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-class-fields/)/[ECMAScriptÂ® 2022 Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-IdentifierName)

In this mehtod, we use **TC39 private class field proposal** The class fields proposal which expands the existing JavaScript class syntax with new functionality that [has been promoted to Stage 4 in the TC39 process and will be officially included in ECMAScript 2022](https://blog.saeloun.com/2021/10/21/ecmacscript-public-instance-fields-and-private-instance-fields.html).

With this approach, **we put a # before the name of a variable and it becomes private** (_that simple, no extra structural changes would be needed!_)

_Note that you might need [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to run this code on your browser, although most modern browsers already support this_.

Look at the sample in this folder to see an example.
