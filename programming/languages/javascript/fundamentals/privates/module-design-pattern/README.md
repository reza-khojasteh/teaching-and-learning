# The [Module Design Pattern](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/module-design-pattern-in-javascript)

The **module design pattern** is very useful in JavaScript. It usese **functions and their scopes** to _simulate public and private_ components (smaller parts/functionalities.)

Using this pattern _we can expose only the parts of the module which should be able to be accessed from outside (i.e other modules) and hide the rest of the implementation (the **privates**_.)

Look at the sample in this folder to see an example.
