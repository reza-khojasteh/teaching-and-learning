# Binary Search and Lower Bound and Upper Bound

The lower and upper bound of a binary search are **the lowest and highest positions where a value could be inserted without breaking the ordering.**

As opposed to a typical binary search algorithm, lower bound search algorithm looks for **the first index of an element (lower bound)** and upper bound search algorithm looks for **the index after last occurrence (upper bound)**.

Lower and upper bound search functions are useful when _trying to insert an element while maintaining a sorted order_, or when _searching for the number of a particular element in a sorted list_.

_The examples here, demonstrate these three_.
