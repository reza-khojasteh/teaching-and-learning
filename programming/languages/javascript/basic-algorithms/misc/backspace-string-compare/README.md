# [Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

_Backspace String Compare_ or _Typed out Strings_ is a problem stated as:

> Given two strings s and t, **return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors** (_'#' means a backspace character and note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty_.)  
> We could assume that both strings _contain only lowercase letters and '#' characters_.
