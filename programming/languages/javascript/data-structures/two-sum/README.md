# [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) # 
_Two Sum problem_ is one of those ones I found interesting, 
due to how changing/turning a data structure might give a better result regarding time/space complexity.

This problem is stated as: 
>Given an array of integers **nums** and an integer **target**, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
>You may assume that each input would _have exactly one solution_, and you _may not use the same element twice_.
