# A Simple Sample to Start with Java's [IntStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/IntStream.html) #  
This interface acts as a [Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html) of **int**s; it is a sequence of **int**s supporting sequential and parallel operations which could be done on a sequence of integer values.  
  
In the sample solution, note that how we are avoiding *imperative* kind of programming (**no *for* loops and the like**) and we have a *declarative* way of doing things.
