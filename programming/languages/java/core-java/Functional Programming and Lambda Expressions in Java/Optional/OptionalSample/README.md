# A Simple Sample to Start with Java's [Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html) #  
  
In the sample solution, note that how we can work with an **Optional** in Java, and how we can use the method **ifPresentOrElse()** (as an example and among other methods)
to check _if a value is present and we should perform the given action with the value_, or _otherwise, we should perform another given action_.
