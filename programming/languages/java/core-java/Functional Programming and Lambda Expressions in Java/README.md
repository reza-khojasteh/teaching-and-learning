# Java 8's [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [Lambda Expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html) #  
In Java 8, **functional programming** and **lambda expressions** were added as language features.  

The two core paradigms of functional programming are **"immutable values"** *(In Functional Programming, we create and use objects 
but we do not change their values or states)* 
and **"elevating functions to first class citizens"** *(In programming language design, a first-class citizen is an entity which supports all the operations 
generally available to other entities)*.
