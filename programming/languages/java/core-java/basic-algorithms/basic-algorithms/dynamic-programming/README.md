# [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) # 
_Dynamic Programming (DP)_ is **an algorithmic technique** for solving a problem (_mostly an optimization problem_.)  

It is based on the fact that _the optimal solution to the overall problem depends on the optimal solutions to its subproblems_.  
**DP would be most effective when we normally have _overlapping subproblems in our recursive solutions_** which we could **_avoid solving them over ond over_** 
by using either the **Top-down/[Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)** or **Bottom-up/Tabulation** approaches.

In each of the subfolders, you can find _[brute force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_force) recursive solutions to a problem vs. its DP solutions_ 
and you would see **how DP helps us reduce time and space complexity**.
